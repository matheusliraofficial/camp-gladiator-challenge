# Camp Gladiator Challenge

## Description

I used a boilerplate with React + TypeScript + Vite to bootstrap the project, I added the Mock Service Worker to mock the API requests and Chakra UI to be the UI library.

## How to setup the project

1. Clone repo in your machine
2. In the project directory, execute: `yarn install`

## Run project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode using the default vite configuration.
